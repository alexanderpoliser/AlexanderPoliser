## Hey there

I'm not sure how you ended up here, but let me take a moment to share a bit about myself with you.

## Detailed information

## Curiosities about me

* I had my first encounter with programming between the ages of 12 and 13, using the C language. However, it was a brief experience since I had no idea what I was doing. A few years later, at 17, I took an introductory course on programming logic, learning to solve problems using code blocks. Shortly after, I participated in a programming competition with a friend. Although we didn’t achieve a great result, that experience sparked my interest in the field even more. It was at that moment I knew for sure that I would pursue a degree to deepen my knowledge and grow in this area.
* At the beginning of 2025, I plan to launch a YouTube channel to share my knowledge about algorithms, data structures, and web development. I strongly believe that the best way to learn and master a subject is by sharing it with others.
